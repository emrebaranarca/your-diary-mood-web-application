**YOUR DIARY MOOD WEB APPLICATION**

In today's world, increasing psychological issues and addictions lower people's quality of life and joy. The lack of self-awareness due to the ever-growing sea of technology and content is constantly increasing, harming social and individual lives. With the Your Diary Mood application, users can track their emotional states, thoughts, and feelings throughout the day and view the analysis and results. The application contributes to increasing individual awareness.

**INCEPTION PHASE**

**Vision**

We will ask users to express their emotional states through the application at specific times. This expression time will be left free for the user, with only reminder notifications permitted as allowed. After reporting their emotions, feelings, and thoughts using emoji expressions, users will be able to see which emotions they experienced throughout the day at the end of the day, raising awareness. Users will be able to track their weekly and monthly emotional changes through the application.
